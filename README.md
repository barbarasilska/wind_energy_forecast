# Forecasting energy generated from wind


## Project Description

Hourly forecast of energy generated in a wind turbine for a given day to minimize balancing costs based on weather data

## Features

- historical data of the energy production for 14 wind turbines for each hour for a period of 3 months (Date, time, volume of energy produced, location data)
- historical weatherdata for three weather stations 
(Temperature, Dew Point, Humidity, Wind, Wind Speed, Wind Gust, Pressure, Precipitation, Condition) andlocation information.
